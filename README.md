# Sahiba Foundation Website

When I was actively working on projects for Webacies, I created this responsive Non-Profit Organization Website for a charity organisation called Sahiba Foundation pro-bono.

In the beginning, I hardcoded everything in HTML - but if I had to remake this website I would use React or a templating language instead of pure HTML. Happy Coding :D
